The competition proceeds in two rounds: an online qualification round on March
12th, and the final round on March 27th and March 28th. The final round
consists of two tasks: a trial task and a main task.

# Participants

The competition is open to students (License, Master, Phd,
Engineering Schools) and professionals, located in France, Belgium, Luxembourg
and Switzerland, as well as in other countries from Francophonie (provided they
can travel to Paris). Google employees, temps, vendors and interns cannot
participate (but they are welcome to help the organization committee :)

# Teams

Participants compete in teams of two to four members. Team composition
cannot be changed after registration closes. A participant may leave a team,
but every team should have at least two members.

# Task

For each round (online and final), a problem statement will be published.
This statement will specify the problem to be solved, input file(s) format of
the expected submission files, and the scoring rules for submission. The input
file(s) will available for download in the judge system, which will also accept
the submission files produced by the teams.

# Scoring

The judge system evaluates each submission and reveals the result to
the team. Each team can make as many submissions as they want. The final score
of the team for a round is the score of the best submission from the team
during that round.

Teams selected for the final round will be contacted on March 16th. For the
final round, the two tasks of the competition are scored individually and the
score of the trial task does not affect the scoring of the main task.

# Requests for Clarification

The participants may request the jury to clarify
some points from the problem statements by email at hashcode2015@google.com. It
is up to the jury to decide whether the points should be clarified or not, and
how. Clarifications will be posted on the site of the competition so that they
are available to all teams.

# Resources

The participants may use any documentation they would like, in paper
form or on the Internet. The participants may also use any computer they have
access to to run their code. The participants are not allowed to benefit from
the support from external people.

# Source Code

The participants must develop original code to generate their
solution. They may use publicly released libraries. The participants must
submit the source code of the program they use to generate their solution so
that the jury can review it. (The participants keep the full ownership of their
code, and we won't use it after the contest, we just want being able to have a
look at it if we need.)

# Fair play

We expect all participants to have a positive attitude during the
contest. In particular, the participants should not take any action that would
prevent other participants from taking part to the contest in good conditions.

# Jury

A jury composed of Google engineers is in charge of enforcing these rules.
The jury will review the submissions of the teams, generate the rankings and
award the prizes. The jury is sovereign for enforcing the rules of the contest
and deciding the awards. The jury may decide at any time to exclude some
participants or teams which would not follow the rules of the contest.
